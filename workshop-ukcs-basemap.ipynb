    "### 1.1 Reinventing the basemap  \n",
    "In this notebook we explore the process of making an interactive E&P basemap for the UK Continental Shelf.\n",
    "\n",
    "A basemap is important for placing many types of E&P data, like well locations, seismic surveys, license blocks and field areas, in their correct spatial context. Historically, large printed E&P basemaps were a standard wall covering in many company offices.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Reflecting the changing times and increasing digitalization, our task in this workshop is to reinvent the E&P basemap using Python code and open data sources provided by the UK Oil and Gas Authority. \n",
    "\n",
    "The task of creating the basemap can be posed as an exercise in **computational thinking** - the process of thinking about a problem and developing a solution in a form that can be solved by a computer. "

    "### 1.2 Problem statement  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by stating the problem as a set of requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Display  \n",
    "The map must display the following objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Quadrants**. Quadrants are 1x1 degree areas that subdivide the UKCS into a regular grid.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Licence blocks**. Licences blocks are areas defined by polygons within which the licence holder is granted permission to explore for resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Field determinations**. Determinations are regularized boundaries that capture the maximum extent of a field and are integral to gaining consent for a field development.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Field outlines**. Field outlines are irregular polygons that define the extent of a hydrocarbon accumulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cultural/satellite background**. Underlying the basemap there should be cultural/satellite imagery showing important geographic features.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interactivity  \n",
    "The map must be interactive with the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pan and zoom**. Users should be able to pan to navigate, and zoom to focus on details.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multi-resolution**. The map must be multi-resolution, meaning that the objects are renderered at a level of detail that depends on the amount of zoom. By zooming right in, users should be able to see the finest details in the displayed objects.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Legend**. The map must have a legend that allows users to hide/show the displayed objects.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hover**. There should be a way of viewing more detail about any of the objects by simply hovering the mouse over an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reuse, sharing, and extensibility  \n",
    "The map must support reuse, sharing, and extensibility as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reuse**. Users should be able to reuse the basemap including all its interactive features in other notebooks without the need to run the code in this notebook again.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sharing**. Users should be able to share the basemap with colleagues by simply sharing a file.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Extensibility**. Users should be able to extend the basemap by adding more objects such as the surface locations of wells, or the location of seismic survey lines. Basic knowledge of Python and the packages used in this notebook should be all that is necessary to achieve this.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data sources\n",
    "The map must be built using data from the following sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **GeoJSON data**. Input data for the basemap comes in the form of GeoJSON files from the Oil and Gas Authority. As you should know by now, GeoJSON is just a standard representation of geospatial data expressed in plain text JSON format. You should also recall that JSON format looks similar to the Python code that creates the objects.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tabular data**. Input data to extend the basemap with well and seismic lines come from (`.csv`) files in tabular form. As you should know by now, these are plain text files that we can read in to `pandas` data frames.  \n",
    "\n",
    "At first sight this may seem like a very challenging set of requirements, but by applying some computational thinking we can break down the problem into manageable pieces. It also helps considerably to know that the Plotly graphics package that we're going to use provides many of the parts we need for basemap display, interactivity, and reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following sections we start by applying computational thinking to sketch out a solution to these requirements, before writing code that implements the basemap using what we have learned in Python 101, 102.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Some cells in this notebook require that you complete the code in order to make progress. If you get stuck, there are solutions in:\n",

    "### 2.1 Recall of computational thinking  \n",
    "\n",
    "To begin let's recall the main elements of computational thinking:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Decomposition**. Break a complex task down into smaller, more manageable parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Patterns**. Identify and utilize reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Representation**. Represent the problem in terms of key data objects, bypassing irrelevant details.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Algorithms**. Express solutions as instructions or recipes using flow charts or pseudocode.\n",

    "Now lets list some initial thoughts on how to apply these ideas to the problem at hand.\n"

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### 2.2 Decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "We can decompose the problem into a number of smaller parts as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data import**. The input data comes in the form of GeoJSON (`.geojson`) and tabular (`.csv`) files - when reading these files we need to consider how best to represent the data they contain in terms of Python objects. An important factor in this decision is any constraint imposed by the display - we must be able to provide the data objects in the correct form for display. In an ideal world we want to use the data objects directly in the form they are read from file. In the basemap it turns out that most of the data **can** be used directly, but as noted in Section 2.4 it will also be necessary to modify the GeoJSON data for display.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Graphics**. The basemap problem is demanding in terms of the requirements for the display and all the interactive features specified in the problem statement. We need to decide how best to make the graphics display, but luckily the Plotly package can handle these requirements. In particular we will use Plotly's Mapbox features to provide the background cultural/satellite imagery and interactivity.   \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sharing**. We need to provide a way to share the basemap display. One way is the export the basemap as a (`.html`) file - we can send this file to others to view in their own web browser - in contrast to a static image this preserves the interactive features.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reuse**. To reuse the basemap at a later date, we can export the basemap as a (`.json`) file containing a definition of the map. This allows us to easily recreate the basemap in a Python notebook without knowing anything about the code that was used to make the basemap in the first place.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Extensibility**. The process of extending the basemap, by adding new display elements like wells and seismic survey lines, is made easy .\n"

    "### 2.3 Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "A recurring pattern we need in our solution is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read objects from an input (`.geojson`) data file.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Convert objects to a representation that can be displayed in the basemap.   \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Add objects to the basemap.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Adjust the styling (colours, opacity, lines etc) of the object display to suit our preferences.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a pattern we need to repeat for each type of object - quadrants, licence blocks, and field determinations, field areas. The order in which we add objects to the basemap is important as later objects overlay (and can obscure) earlier objects. A good choice for this problem is to add objects in the following order:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Quadrants.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Licence blocks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Field determinations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Field areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "and when we come to extend the map later on, we can add:\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Well surface locations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Seismic survey lines."

   "source": [
    "### 2.4 Representation of data objects\n",
    "\n",
    "- **GeoJSON data**. The GeoJSON input data is really convenient for this project because it easiliy represents the complex data structures comprising both nested geometry and property information. One complicating factor is that we will need to change the representation of this data to create a *flattened* or tabular version of the object properties. This is a constraint imposed by the way the Plotly Mapbox display expects to receive data for a filled polygon (or choropleth) display.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Flattening**. In the same folder as this notebook is a module called `flatten_geojson.py` which defines a function for performing this flattening operation. It takes an object as its argument and returns a `pandas` data frame containing the properties in a tabular form. This is simply an alternative representation of the object properties, the data values themselves remain unchanged.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tabular data**. The well data is provided in a (`.csv`) file, and after being loaded into a `pandas` data frame can be directly displayed on the basemap without any modification.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The same remark applies to the seismic line CDP locations. This data is also provided in a (`.csv`) file and once in a `pandas` data frame can be directly displayed on the basemap.\n"

    "\n",
    "Another question of representation concerns how best to represent the basemap graphics in order to satisfy the interactivity, reuse, sharing, and extensibility requirements. There are several options available, as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pixel-based image**. The basemap graphics can be saved to a pixel-based image and stored in variety of formats like (`.png`) or (`.jpg`) using the `write_image()` function provided by Plotly. One limitation is that this representation fails on the multi-resolution display requirement as the image will appear pixelated beyond a certain zoom level. In fact, this representation fails to satisfy most of the requirements outlined in the problem statement.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **HTML file**. The basemap graphics can be saved to a (`.html`) file using the `write_html()` function provided by Plotly. This satisfies the multi-resolution display requirement along with the requirements for interactivity and sharing. The sharing requirement is easily satisfied by simply sharing the (`.html`) file with a colleague e.g., by email. One limitation is that it does not satisfy the extensibility requirement, as it is not suited to making further modifications in a notebook.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **JSON file**. The basemap graphics can be saved to a (`.json`) file using the `write_json()` function provided by Plotly. This representation can be read in a notebook to recreate the basemap and make further additions, satisfying the requirements for reuse and extensibility. The file can also be shared with colleagues so that they can also recreate and manipulate the basemap in their own notebooks.  "
